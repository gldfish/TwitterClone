# Twitter Clone

## Repository Owner

- Each group must assign one repository owner
- The repository owner must fork this repository. Only the repository owner should fork the repository
  - This could be done by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right.
- The repository owner must invite their goupmates as collaborators in their fork
  - This could be done by going to Settings>Collaborators>Add people
- The group must use the fork to collaborate on their project. They must commit and push their code in their forks.
- The group must submit the link of the repository of the repository owner in the submission bin

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Twitter Clone project:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official website.

2. **Fork and Clone the Repository**:

   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository.
   - Install the API dependencies by running the command:
     ```
     npm run init-api
     ```
   - Install the UI dependencies by running the command:
     ```
     npm run init-ui
     ```

4. **Run the API**:

   - Start the API server by running:
     ```
     npm run start-api
     ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/api` in your web browser to check if the API is up and running.
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/docs` in your web browser to see the documentation of the API.

5. **Run the UI**:

   - Open a new terminal window (keep the API terminal running).
   - Start the UI development server with:
     ```
     npm run start-ui
     ```
   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your web browser to see if the UI is working.

6. **Start Developing**:
   - Begin working on the UI in the `TwitterCloneUi` folder.
   - Add your HTML, CSS, and JS files to build the Twitter Clone interface.

Remember: **Do not modify the `TwitterCloneApi` folder**; it contains essential API code.

## Deployment

To deploy this application you need to to use netlify. See the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/) to see how deployments are done in Netlify.

The netlify.toml file contains nearly all the necessary values needed for deploying the application. There are no additional values needed to be set up except the JWT_KEY environment variable

## Step by step Deployment Guide

The deployment process for netlify should be straight forward, but here's a step by step guide in case you need it.

1. Make sure that your forked is synced
2. Visit [the netlify website](https://netlify.app/) and click on "Deploy to Netlify"
3. Create an account and sign up with your github profile
4. Click on the "Add new site" button and select "Import and Exisitng Project"
5. Click on "Deploy with Github". Netlify might ask for Authentication in which case you would need to allow Netlify.
6. Select your repository from the list.
7. Set the site name to your desired name.
8. The `Build command`, `Publish directory`, and `Functions directory` should be prefilled with the necessary information. If not, make sure to sync your fork and check again.
9. Click on "Deploy" and wait a couple of minutes for netlify to deploy your application. Once netlify is finished, a green tag with the text "Published" should appear in "Production Deploys"
10. Et voila, you have deployed your application üéâ Now you need to step up the JWT_KEY

### Setting up the JWT_KEY

The JWT_KEY is used to generate the tokens and make sure that the tokens generated by the system is indeed generated by the system itself. Otherwise, attackers might be able to generate tokens themselves and compromise the system. This is why the key needs to be generated and entered manually. They must not be known to anyone but the developers.

1. To setup the JWT_KEY environment variable, you would first need to generate a secret key. You may refer to [this](https://dev.to/tkirwa/generate-a-random-jwt-secret-key-39j4) tutorial for generating a secret key
   - Once generated, your private key may look something like this `ddcb75b4f402f240234eec4bf175fa9e8c15aea5...`
2. Once you have created a secret key, you need to add your private key as an environment variable. The name of the key must be `JWT_KEY` and the value is your private key.
   - You may refer to [this](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#site-environment-variables) documentation for a tutorial on how to set environment variables in netlify

Happy coding! üöÄüê¶

# How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.

## 1. üí¨ 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Our social media project employs GitHub for version control, collaboration, and Visual Studio Code as our source code editor. We have categorized our codebase to separate JavaScript, HTML, and CSS style functions based on their respective roles in the front-end design.
>
> JavaScript is the foundation of our project, serving as the backbone for the website's front-end functionality and as the language for structuring our custom API. This integration facilitates seamless communication between the user interface and the server, resulting in a dynamic and responsive user experience.
>
> Moreover, we utilize the fetch API method to gather data from various sources, allowing us to dynamically populate news sections on the website. This approach ensures a constantly updated and engaging user experience, while also establishing scalable and efficient data management within our social media project.


## 2. üí¨ 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>What was your inspiration for the design of the website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Our website design is a fusion of distinctive elements, drawing inspiration from three iconic brands - Discord, Twitter and Apple. We prioritize a clean and intuitive interface, inspired by Discord, to ensure an uncomplicated and user-friendly experience. 
>
> The neutral color background, similar to the classic Twitter layout, provides a calming backdrop, fostering readability and it is visually appealing. Additionally, we adopt Apple's approach to simplicity and concise features, focusing on essential functionalities without unnecessary complexities.
>
> This blend of design inspirations reflects our commitment to creating a visually appealing, user-centric, and functionally efficient website for our users.


## 3. üí¨ 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>What was your approach in creating the content of the website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Our approach to creating the content of the website began with a collaborative brainstorming session among team members. During this process, we discussed the goals, target audience, and key messaging of Telelet. We then translated these discussions into concrete design ideas by starting the mockup of our website in Figma. This iterative process allowed us to visualize and refine the content structure, ensuring that it aligns with our objectives and resonates with our audience.


## 4. üí¨ 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>How is your website creative?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Our website showcases creativity in several ways. Firstly, we carefully selected a color palette for Telelet that reflects the brand's identity and values, while also enhancing the user experience. Additionally, we thought outside the box when designing both the web and mobile layouts, incorporating unique elements and intuitive navigation features that set Telelet apart from other social media platforms. By combining innovative design choices with user-centric functionality, our website delivers a fresh and engaging experience for users.


## 5. üí¨

# How you worked as a team to accomplish the project.

## 1. üí¨ 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Firstly, we assigned team members to create distinct pages, each with its media queries, such as the profile, feed, discover, user login, and register pages. Zhen together with Louise was assigned to the profile page, and Vince was assigned to user login and register. Lastly, Wince and Georgette were assigned to the feed and discover page. This approach allowed us to focus on individual page layouts, ensuring a seamless and responsive design across various devices.
> 
> Once the layout phase was complete, we collaborated to shift gears to backend development. We allocated responsibilities for implementing the necessary functions on each page, turning our design into a fully operational and user-friendly website. We divided the tasks to make the most of each team member's strengths and expertise. This helped us create a development process that was efficient and well-rounded.


## 2. üí¨ 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> Our team has implemented a systematic solution to prevent conflicts and ensure a smooth collaborative coding process. Georgette and Wince are responsible for handling the push and commit changes on GitHub. The rest of the team submits their completed code to Georgette and Wince, who meticulously reviews each submission for any structural inconsistencies or conflicts. 
>
> This thorough examination allows them to address potential issues before merging the code into the main repository. Once satisfied with the submitted code, Georgette and Wince initiate the commit and push, seamlessly integrating the contributions from the entire team. This collaborative approach streamlines the development process and ensures the stability and coherence of our codebase.

# Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

> [!NOTE]
> Working with this group to create a social media platform has been a milestone for us as a CS student. We split up tasks, like designing pages and adding features. The best part is how we all contribute to the creative side, choosing the brand name, logo, and colors. This project is like a puzzle, and every individual contributes their piece and showcases skills and ideas. Even when things get tricky, it feels great when we figure it out together. This project has shown us that teamwork is super important, and it's awesome to see our ideas come to life in our social media creation.
